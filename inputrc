# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for programs that use
# the GNU Readline library. Existing programs include ftp, bash, and gdb.
#
# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r. Lines beginning with '#' are
# comments.


# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable assignments from
# /etc/inputrc
$include /etc/inputrc

# never ring the terminal's bell
set bell-style none

# enable 8-bit input and output
set input-meta on
set output-meta on

# To allow the use of 8bit-characters like the german umlauts, turn off
# convert-meta (default value is on). However this makes the meta key not work
# as a meta key, which is annoying to those which don't need to type in 8-bit
# characters.
#set convert-meta off
